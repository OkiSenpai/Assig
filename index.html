                1935)</b>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. <br>
            <br>
            Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
            long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along
            the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization"). <br> <br>
            Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which
